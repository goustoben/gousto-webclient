        Exceptionally high quality ingredients, superb meat, great big portions. No waste - one of the best bits - and a significant saving on our weekly food bill. Super excited when the box arrives each week!

        Our boring meals are once again adventurous! Food bill is reduced as I no longer buy veg and meat that I forget to use. On to our third week of orders now - delicious!
