# @library/http

This is a library for making HTTP requests. It's written to support the new feature modules, but can also be called
within the main webclient.

_This library is work-in-progress_

It's owned by frontend foundations

## What can I do with this?

- ðŸ“– Declare how your backend APIs want to be called
