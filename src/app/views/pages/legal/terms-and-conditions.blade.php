					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>This website is owned and operated by SCA Investments Limited trading as “Gousto”. Our company information is at the end of this document.</li>
						<li>Please read these terms and conditions carefully. They apply when you buy any goods via this site. (There are separate terms which apply to your use of our site.) Please print or save these terms for future use as we will not keep a file copy specifically for the transaction with you and we cannot guarantee that they will remain accessible on our website in future. These terms and conditions are available in the English language only.</li>
						<li>Where we refer to “Consumer” below we mean an individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside that person’s trade, business, craft or profession.</li>
						<li>We are legally required to remind Consumers that we are under a legal duty to supply goods that are in conformity with the contract. Furthermore, nothing below affects Consumers’ legal rights in relation to goods that are not in conformity with the contract, whether because they are faulty, not as described or otherwise. You can get advice about your legal rights from your local Trading Standards office or Citizens' Advice Bureau.</li>
						<li>We may change these terms and conditions at any time by posting a new version on our site and/or by emailing them to you. Please check them carefully as they will apply to any recurring deliveries or new orders occurring after the effective date shown.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Right to cancel</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>If you are an EU Consumer, you have the right to cancel this contract subject to the provisions set out below. This right is not affected by any separate returns policy on our website.</li>
						<li>There is no right to cancel contracts for the supply of goods liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly. This applies to most of the goods we supply.</li>
						<li>If you do have the right to cancel, the following instructions apply: </li>
						<li>You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.</li>
						<li>The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires, physical possession of the goods (or the first delivery of goods in the case of recurring orders).</li>
						<li>To exercise, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this contract by a clear action or statement. This includes choosing to cancel your account via the ‘My Details’ tab in your Gousto account, contacting our customer care team via the ‘get in touch’ button at the bottom of the <a href="{{{ URL::to('help') }}}">Help Page</a> and requesting for your account to be cancelled, or calling our customer care team on 02036999996 to ask for an account cancellation.</li>
						<li>To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Minor variations in goods</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>We will take reasonable care to ensure that representations and descriptions of goods appearing on our website are correct. We have made reasonable efforts to display as accurately as possible the appearance of our goods.</li>
						<li>The labelling or packaging of the goods you receive may differ from the images of these which you see on our site.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Your order </h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Your order is an offer to buy from us on a one-off or recurring delivery basis.</li>
						<li>You place your order by using the ordering process on our website or our digital services including but not limited to our apps (the term “website” shall hereafter refer to the website and our other digital services). This involves making the selection on our site and transmitting the order to us by clicking on the “Pay Now” button. This process permits you to check and amend any errors before making an order by using the change function and/or the internet browser back button. You can also change your order any time up to the relevant cut-off date / time (see further below).</li>
						<li>You must ensure that your order and any other information you supply to us is correct and you must promptly update us if there are any changes.</li>
						<li>We will send you a confirmation email after your order and this constitutes our acceptance and is the point at which a binding legal contract is formed.</li>
						<li>We are not obliged to supply any goods which are unavailable (notwithstanding that we have accepted your offer). If any goods are unavailable, we will notify you of the unavailability as soon as possible and will arrange a credit if you have been charged.</li>
						<li>You acknowledge that, for recurring orders, we will select the relevant recipes for you if you do not make your own selection by the cut-off date/time specified on our site.</li>
						<li>The default method of communication for all correspondence from us will be over email, using the email provided on your account. In certain circumstances we may need to contact you over phone instead.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Payment and price</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>The price for the goods is as stated on our site at the time you order. VAT or sales tax is included unless we say otherwise.</li>
						<li>The following only applies if we charge for delivery: Delivery costs are charged extra at the rate shown on our site at the time you place your order. These will depend on the delivery method chosen.</li>
						<li>Payment is required in advance as explained below.</li>
						<li>You authorise us and our third party payment provider to take payment and/or to charge your payment card for the relevant amounts and at the relevant times. Despatch of the goods is subject to our being able to charge your payment card. It is your responsibility to update your payment card details as necessary. A nominal (1p) charge may be incurred if you change your payment card details.</li>
						<li>We will take your first payment when we accept your order. If you have purchased a subscription plan, payments will be taken after the relevant cut-off date/time specified on our site (which may change from time to time), depending on the delivery date(s) you select.</li>
						<li>Recurring deliveries can be cancelled or changed at any time via the site before the relevant cut-off for a particular delivery (subject to any applicable legal right to cancel set out in the section 2 above).</li>
						<li>The cut off for any delivery occurs at midday, three days before your delivery day.</li>
						<li>If you revise the contents of your first box before the delivery cut off so that the cost is less than it was originally, the difference will be credited to your account. Alternatively, the difference can be refunded to you by requesting this from our customer care team via the 'get in touch' form at the bottom of the <a href="{{{ URL::to('help') }}}">Help Page</a>. Changes made to subsequent boxes before cut-off will be reflected in the amount taken as payment.</li>
						<li>We may change our prices by giving you notice by email at least 14 days before any price change takes effect. If you do not accept the new price, you should cancel your subscription as explained below as payments taken after the notice period will be at the new price.</li>
						<li>We may from time to time offer some recipes which attract an additional surcharge. This surcharge is clearly shown on the website and will be added to the cost of your standard subscription should you choose these recipes.</li>
						<li>You must contact us immediately with full details if you dispute any payment.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Discount codes and credits</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>We may offer discount codes from time to time. All discount codes refer to the price excluding (if applicable) delivery surcharges and any additional clearly marked surcharges associated with certain recipes that may feature on the menu from time to time. Such codes may only be applied to purchases made through the account in respect of which the discount code was offered and registered and are not transferable or redeemable for cash. Unless otherwise stated: codes (1) are only available for future new orders placed online, (2) cannot be used retrospectively, (3) can only be redeemed once per customer, (4) cannot be redeemed against products sold in the Market and (5) cannot be redeemed against the additional clearly marked surcharges associated with certain recipes that may feature on the menu from time to time. Also you cannot use more than one discount code per transaction unless we state otherwise; if we do so, the order in which the codes are to be applied is in our sole discretion.</li>
						<li>Discount codes are subject to any additional specific terms and conditions which are specified at the point of issue. We reserve the right to discontinue or otherwise modify any discount codes at any time without prior notice.</li>
						<li>We may allocate credit to your account in certain circumstances, e.g. when you sign up, refer a friend or as a marketing incentive. Credits cannot be exchanged for cash and are non-transferable. Credits expire after the time periods specified in the FAQs on our website. The validity period starts from the time the credit is allocated to your account. Any unused credit on your account will automatically expire if your account is closed. Credit can be used against the cost of standard recipes, the additional surcharges associated with certain recipes, special delivery surcharges and Market items, and is redeemed automatically upon checkout.</li>
						<li>Refer-a-friend credits only apply if the referred user is a third party who has been genuinely referred by you on an arm’s length basis and if the delivery address is to a different address to that of the referrer.</li>
						<li>New user credits apply only to the first account opened by you. It must not be used in connection with multiple accounts created or controlled by the same person.</li>
						<li>We reserve the right to reject any discount code or credit and/or reclaim the amount of any discount or credit if we consider that it is being used in breach of these terms or is otherwise being abused.</li>
						<li>We may occasionally offer customers their nth box free. In order to successfully claim this free box, it must have the same or less monetary value as the first box you purchased, otherwise we reserve the right to withdraw this offer. Any additional surcharges for certain recipes and the cost of any items from the Market will still be applied in full to this box – the offer applies only to the standard recipes selected for the box.</li>

If you are not a Consumer, we have no liability for any losses arising from delay in delivery.</li>
						<li>If you receive notification of an unsuccessful attempted delivery, it is your responsibility to use the details provided to contact the delivery company to arrange re-delivery.
