# ScrollCarousel

Display an optional header and footer that don't scroll, and content (via
children of `ScrollCarouselBody`) that scrolls if its width is more than
available.  The ScrollCarousel component itself takes the full width of the
parent; we assume that somewhere in the body's `children` there is a component
that has explicit width.

Note on spacing: if you include this component on a page, for best results you
shouldn't have `padding` on the page itself, but instead have an equal padding
on each component except `ScrollCarousel`; so that there is no space between the end
of the scrollable container and the edge of the screen.
