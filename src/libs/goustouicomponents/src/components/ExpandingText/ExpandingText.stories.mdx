# ExpandingText

This component shortens text for small screens and adds "read more" button.

`charsPerLine` prop is used as a rough indicator on how many characters per line are available for each breakpoint. Each entry on that array corresponds to screens that are small, medium, large, extra-large. It is used to calculate roughly how many characters are needed to fill in the number of lines. This is a simplified, MVP solution for this component as the automated one involved debouncers and JavaScript to measure the available space.
